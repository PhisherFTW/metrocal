            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use your weapons in positions for them to succeed such as the pistols and smgs at close range and Rifles at longer ranges.</li>
                    <li>When you suspect the enemies are ecoing or doing a light buy, keep your distance and don’t get close.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you lock your crosshair onto the enemy before you start spraying because I noticed a few times you would start spraying before your crosshair was on the enemy making it much much more difficult for you to land the kill.</li>
                    <li>Your pathing and movement could use some work I noticed a few times you would bump into a wall/teammate by accident which messed you up a little bit also sometimes you were too close to your teammates which caused you to die instantly if the enemy had a good spray.</li>
                    <li>When clearing angles you have the idea down and your crosshair placement is decent but you are rushing things often your crosshair placement would be good but you would move onto the next angle too quickly, which caused the enemy to peek the angle you were holding and kill you just after you moved on, just slow things down a little bit and focus on perfecting your peeks instead of trying to make things quicker, that will come with time.</li>
                    <li>Getting a little kill-hungry a few times during that game, I completely understand the urges but you have to fight against it, because being kill hungry sure it will sometimes pad your scores but at the end of the day that doesn’t matter its your individual improvement that matters, ontop of just padding your score if you are too kill hungry it can lead to you having worse economy if you die while going for kill and in bad cases lead to your team losing rounds that you would have won if you were not greedy.</li>
                    <li>Early rotate, this only happened once during this game but it is something to look out for because it is one of the easiest ways to throw a round in csgo is by getting too many people to leave a site wide open and once the Terrorists have the bomb down and are in good afterplant situations its almost impossible to mount a solid retake so in most cases you would want to put up a good fight before the bomb goes down.</li>
                    <li>Playing the same angle over and over again especially on CT side is a terrible idea as it allows for the enemies to figure out ways to counter you this includes prefiring and knowing your exact position, I would never recommend sitting in a position that the enemies know you will be in as this can lead to you dying very quickly from an awp peek or a prefire as the terrorists have better weaponry and this completely throws away your CT advantage which is the choice to choose a different position every single round without the enemies knowing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                    <br>
                    Started T side
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Armour, going outside on pistol round is an incredibly difficult fight if you face enemies as there are so many long-range angles and the usp is far superior to the Glock at that kind of range, I always recommend playing to your pistols strengths which for the Glock is its accuracy while spamming and high rate of fire and it's incredibly deadly at close range so try to always pick paths that will allow you to take advantage of your weapon, nice calm tapping onto the enemy site from mouth, this allowed you to secure a kill although you were not in the optimal range for the Glock you managed to effectively use counter strafing to avoid getting headshot while properly executing shots when standing still. W</li>
                    <li>AK Armour, now this round I would have recommended going outside as your team had the buy and the cts could only get weapons by going inside this round it would force you to take closer range engagements when fighting the enemy giving the pistols the advantage so I would recommend trying to get some space so you can take advantage of your superior weaponry, a little bit of panic spraying when you got dealt some damage and this would have made it incredibly hard for you to actually adjust to where the enemy is, I recommend only shooting after you have located the enemy and locked your crosshair on them. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good plan to do a rush while still having the weak second round smgs and smart positioning choice to stay further back as you had the upgraded weaponry, when engaging in thr 1v1 single door there were a few mistakes such as crosshair placement being too far out, and doing too many shoulder jiggles which gave away your positioning and allowed the enemy to do significant damage while you were not able to do any, although you did manage to kill him, unfortunately, it was too slow as he was buying time for his teammates to push ramp as well and instantly got the trade on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good use of angles top silo to create a headshot angle for yourself, while moving through A main your pathing could have been better as you didn't seem sure of where you wanted to go but this did give away your teams intentions and that is why when you executed on the A site there were already 3 waiting, you started shooting before your crosshair was on the enemy this caused your spray to lag behind him as he pushed you with an SMG and there wasn't anything you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, exiting Squeaky A, you got dealt with from an m4 at an interesting off-angle by hut. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good movement onto silo and a nice attempt at trading your teammates who died outside but in the engagement you were not fully focused and your crosshair placement was slightly off and the enemy red container hit a nice shot. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, there was a bit of a rough ramp take and your pathing into ramp wasn't clean which caused a bit of bumping into teammates, a good attempt at getting a kill mouth solid preaim and movement but because of your low hp there was nothing you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good angle clearing onto the A site unfortunately they were sitting on Hut ready for you and you were just not quite ready enough for that. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle Armour, going outside with the Deagle is a good idea as it allows you to effectively use the one-hit headshot potential of the Deagle, very nice preaim and peek onto the enemy holding door with the awp very clean Juan, and unfortunately, after that you got traded but you did you job that round and your teammates managed to clean up. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a good attempt at angle clearing ramp but you were too quick to change angles and this caused your crosshair to flick off the position of the enemy and when they peeked you were not ready for them. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good reaction to get the kill on the enemy pushing hell, nice use of the heaven 1-way smoke to push onto the A site, unfortunately, you tried to take the engagement peeking from heaven down the ladder shooting down is much hard than shooting up so that is why the enemy was able to do so much damage so quickly. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good use of positioning mouth to catch the enemy in A site off guard but you instantly dropped your guard and ran into A main which the cts had control of which promptly got you punished. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice spray getting a triple kill although it was a dangerous play as you took the engagement close range against pistol, fortunately, the all lined up and decided against shooting through each other, you did get a little kill hungry going for the fourth which for future is not a good idea since you challenged the eco player with your Glock if you had died with your full set of utility, Armour and weapon that would have been a huge waste especially since the score is so close 7-6. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, was nice dropping for a teammate, during this round you finally did get punished for pushing in super close range with an AK vs five seven, and you whole team did the same eventually losing you the round against an eco. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again you were shooting before your crosshair was on the enemy making damaging the moving enemy incredibly difficult, and on your second engagement dealing with the flanking enemy, you started shooting before you counter strafed which caused your bullets to be inaccurate. L</li>
                    <li>CT Armour, nice info-gathering mouth and fast rotate lowers, but it was too early which left A site completely open to the enemies, then on the retake you left the position to look at hut which is where your teammate was holding and when you went back to the position you were meant to be holding which was door you had lost your holding advantage and once you peeked they knew exactly where you were and dealt with you. W</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice door Molly, unfortunately, you were a bit kill hungry which caused you to play overly aggressively and give away your position which that ontop of the enemy having the weaponry advantage made that fight very hard to win. W</li>
                    <li>M4 Armour, nice reqcti9n to get the kill on the enemy through the hole in the door. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, fantastic prefire through the smoke and through the door to get that kill, and really solid positioning and spray control to get the second, nice job quick switching to pull out the pistol to deal with the third and nice idea to go agro for the fourth but unfortunately you flicked too hard right off the enemy which caused you to whiff. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good damage on the squeaky rush and nice double kill on the enemies pushing onto site, but unfortunately you were not looking for the gap in the smoke by squeaky and vents which allowed the enemy to get a double kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you played a predictable position mouth holding a predictable angle which allowed the enemy to open squeaky and prefire you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice cleanup kill after they rushed A again. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again you played the same angle mouth although fortunately you got the kill on the enemy but not before taking a significant amount of damage and imposing a significant amount of risk on yourself, good idea to switch weaponry with the awper because of your low hp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, you again chose the same angle mouth and got punished, the enemy will usually have the advantage because they can choose when they peek and prefire you and there are a limited number of angles you can be in, I do not recommend continuing to take this fight as the odds are in the terrorist favour. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I like the slight adaptation you have done by primarily focusing on spamming through vents into squeaky and just focusing on when the door opens, nice quick rotate into B site but you get stuck as double doors on the stairs which looks very comfortable, although you manage to get one before getting traded I recommend trying to get into a better position before taking that first fight and try to make it a 1v1. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little bit of a wasted Molly door as it probably wouldn't have done much damage or prevented any sort of push, because of lack of comms and your focus on door you didn't realize how much space the enemies had taken outside so when you went to face them they were in positions you didn't expect and were able to deal with you. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle Armour, nice push into squeaky which you then caught the awper trying to retreat unfortunately you didn't expect the flank so soon which caught you. W</li>
